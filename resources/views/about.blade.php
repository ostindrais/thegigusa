            <h1>About The GIG</h1>
            <p>The GIG is a creation and production of Invisual Digital™, a Trade Mark of Video Arts Systems &amp; Technology, Inc., a New Jersey based corporation.
                It is a program dedicated to featuring independent musicians, bands and singer/songwriters. Each episode of The GIG will feature these artists
                performing in a concert or an informally staged setting, depending upon the artists. In addition, they will also be interviewed, for and by the
                audience and their fans, providing them insights into the artists' music, their lives, and their personalities. They will interact with their
                audience before, during and after the performance segments of the show through an active and engaging online component.
            </p>
            <p>The concept for The GIG harkens back to music-oriented programs that have been popular since the earliest days of TV. From American Bandstand to
                Shindig, Hullabaloo, Don Kirshner’s Rock Concert, Soul Train, the original conception of MTV, and a host of related variety shows hosted by
                Ed Sullivan, Sonny &amp; Cher, Tom Jones, and even Dean Martin, Mitch Miller and Lawrence Welk, to name a few of the more popular shows that
                audiences enjoyed throughout the decades. Programs such as these don’t exist today, and The GIG will pick up that mantle, updated and
                unique to its own flavor and design.
            </p>
            <p>But here’s the best part that promises to be the most dynamic aspect of its concept. Rather than being available to audiences on one specific
                TV channel or cable network, one day a week at a specific time only, through the technology available today, it will be available on premium
                streaming outlets such as Roku, Fire TV, and Apple TV, simultaneously. This will allow the broadest amount of exposure because each program
                will ‘live’ on its own channel within the line-up of these streaming platforms and each one will be available on-demand (VOD) with long-tail
                persistence.
            </p>

            <p>The GIG will feature concert style performances with a virtual audience. There will also be an ongoing, online BATTLE OF THE TRIBUTE BANDS
                that fans will be voting on to crown the winner!

                Intimate performances will also be featured on The GIG, bringing individual independent musicians and singer/songwriters up close and personal
                to their audiences and fans. They will also have the chance to interact with the artists, which will be a special treat for both fans and
                artists, alike!
